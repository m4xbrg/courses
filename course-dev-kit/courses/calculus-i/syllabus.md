## 1) Purpose
Calculus is the **language of change**, forming the mathematical foundation for modern science, engineering, economics, and data analysis. It enables precise modeling of motion, growth, flow, and optimization. For consultants and system designers, calculus provides tools to analyze dynamics and choose actions that maximize value or minimize risk. It also strengthens abstraction, problem solving, and clear communication—habits that transfer far beyond mathematics.

## 2) Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Analyze limits and continuity of functions.
2. Apply differentiation rules to polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions.
3. Model and solve optimization problems in economics, physics, and engineering contexts.
4. Interpret derivatives as rates of change and slopes of tangent lines.
5. Integrate functions using substitution and apply definite integrals via the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
6. Compute areas/accumulations and interpret integrals in real-world problems.
7. Synthesize problem-solving strategies across symbolic, graphical, and numerical approaches.
8. Communicate mathematical reasoning clearly in written and symbolic form.
