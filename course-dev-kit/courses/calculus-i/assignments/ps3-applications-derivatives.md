# Problem Set 3 — Applications of Derivatives

Solve each problem. For word problems, define variables, model with equations, and interpret your solution.

**1.** Find critical points of \\(f(x)=x^3-3x^2+1\\) and classify (local min/max/saddle).

**2.** Find global extrema of \\(f(x)=x^2-4x+3\\) on \\([0,5]\\).

**3.** Given cost \\(C(q)=0.5q^2+4q+100\\), find the marginal cost and marginal cost at \\(q=10\\).

**4.** Given demand \\(p(q)=100-2q\\), revenue \\(R(q)=p(q)q\\). Find \\(R'(q)\\) and the output that maximizes revenue.

**5.** Related rates: A ladder 10 ft long slides down a wall. When the bottom is 6 ft from the wall, it slides away at 2 ft/s. How fast is the top descending?

**6.** Related rates: Water flows into an inverted cone (radius=3 m, height=6 m) at 2 m^3/min. How fast is the water level rising when depth=2 m?

**7.** Optimization: Find dimensions of a rectangle of maximum area inscribed under \\(y=12-2x\\), x∈[0,6].

**8.** Find intervals of increase/decrease and concavity for \\(f(x)=x\\ln x\\) (x>0).

**9.** Use linear approximation to estimate \\(\\sqrt{9.2}\\).

**10.** Newton's method: Find a root of \\(x^3-2=0\\) starting at x=1 (2 iterations).

**11.** Motion: For s(t)=t^3-6t^2+9t, find velocity and acceleration; classify turning points.

**12.** Elasticity: For demand \\(p(q)=\\frac{120}{q+2}\\), compute elasticity at q=3.

**13.** Optimization with constraint: Maximize area of a rectangle with perimeter 20.

**14.** Mean Value Theorem: Verify MVT holds for \\(f(x)=\\ln x\\) on [1, e]; find c.

**15.** Curve analysis: \\(f(x)=\\frac{x}{x^2+1}\\) — asymptotes, extrema, inflection points.

**16.** WORD: A company’s profit \\(\\Pi(q)= -0.1q^2 + 8q - 50\\). What production level maximizes profit, and what is the maximum profit?

**17.** WORD: A cylindrical can must hold 500 cm^3. Find dimensions minimizing surface area.

**18.** WORD: A beam’s strength is proportional to its width times the square of its height. For fixed cross-sectional area A, choose width/height to maximize strength.
