# Mini-Capstone — Optimization in the Real World

**Goal:** Model a real system with calculus and recommend an optimal decision.

## Deliverables
- **Report (5 pages)** — Executive summary, model, analysis, recommendations, limitations.
- **Visualizations (2–3)** — Graphs of key functions (cost/revenue, rate vs. time, etc.).
- **Appendix** — Derivations and checks (optional).

## Suggested Topics
- **Business:** Price/quantity to maximize revenue or profit; cost minimization with constraints.
- **Engineering/Physics:** Minimizing energy, material, or time; maximizing efficiency or throughput.
- **Civic/Health:** Resource allocation, exposure minimization, or growth control models.

## Process
1. **Choose a system** and define variables and assumptions.
2. **Formulate functions** (objective & constraints) using calculus-ready expressions.
3. **Analyze derivatives** to find critical points and classify optima.
4. **Validate** with graphs/numerics; perform a brief sensitivity analysis.
5. **Recommend** a decision; discuss trade-offs and limitations.
