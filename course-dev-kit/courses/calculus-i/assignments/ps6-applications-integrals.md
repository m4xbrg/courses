# Problem Set 6 — Applications of Integrals

Apply integrals to compute areas, accumulations, and physical/economic quantities.

**1.** Area between curves: y=x^2 and y=2x on [0,2].

**2.** Area enclosed by y=\\sin x and y=\\cos x on [0,\\pi/2].

**3.** Find c so that the area between y=x and y=c on [0, c] equals 2.

**4.** Accumulation: If rate r(t)=3t^2+1, find total accumulation from t=0 to t=2.

**5.** Average value of f(x)=\\sqrt{x} on [0,4].

**6.** Center of mass (1D rod): density \\(\\rho(x)=1+x\\) on [0,2]. Find \\(\\bar{x}\\).

**7.** Consumer surplus: demand p(q)=100-2q, market price p=60. Compute consumer surplus.

**8.** Producer surplus: supply p(q)=20+q, market price p=50. Compute producer surplus.

**9.** Work: Force F(x)=5x (N) moves an object from x=0 to x=3 (m). Compute work.

**10.** Work pumping: Tank shaped as a hemisphere radius 2 m, filled to the brim. Compute work to pump out (assume density of water). (Set up integral.)

**11.** Probability density check: For f(x)=kx on [0,2], choose k so that ∫f=1; compute E[X].

**12.** Exponential growth: dP/dt=0.2P with P(0)=100. Solve and find P(10).

**13.** Logistic model setup: dP/dt=rP(1-P/K). With r=0.5, K=1000, set up (do not solve). What does the integral represent?

**14.** Arc length setup: y=\\frac{1}{3}x^{3/2} on [0,4]. (Set up the integral; evaluate if comfortable.)

**15.** Surface of revolution setup: y=\\sqrt{x} rotated around x-axis from 0 to 4.

### Applied Project Prompts (choose one)
1) **Business — Consumer Surplus Deep Dive:** Using a real or assumed linear demand curve with your own parameters, compute equilibrium and consumer surplus; discuss sensitivity to slope/intercept.
2) **Physics — Variable Force Work:** Choose a realistic force profile F(x) (spring, drag approximation, gravity over small height), compute work over a path; discuss modeling assumptions.
3) **Data — Accumulation & Smoothing:** Given a noisy rate signal r(t), propose a smoothed integral estimate of total accumulation; compare methods.
