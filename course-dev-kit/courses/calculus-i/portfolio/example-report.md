# Example Optimization Report — Profit Maximization (Sample)

**Author:** Example Student  
**Date:** 2025-09-09

We analyze a simple firm with demand \(p(q)=100-2q\), revenue \(R(q)=qp(q)\), and cost \(C(q)=0.5q^2+4q+100\). Profit \(\Pi(q)=R(q)-C(q)\).

- \(R(q)=100q-2q^2\)  
- \(\Pi'(q)=100-4q - (q+4)\) after simplifying derivatives where needed (students should complete steps).  
- First-order condition \(\Pi'(q)=0\) → solve for \(q^*\).  
- Second-order test confirms maximum.  
- Graphs of revenue, cost, profit support the solution.  

**Recommendation:** Produce at \(q^*\) units; compare margin to capacity constraints; discuss sensitivity to demand slope/intercept.
